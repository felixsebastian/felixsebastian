# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Felix Sebastian**, full stack software developer and creator of [LexiQuest](https://lexiquest.app).

I build web apps from end to end with a love for clean code and human centred design.

## Favourite tech

I'm big on Python, Golang, Rust; event driven tools like Kafka and Flink; cool database technologies like Cassandra, Neo4j. GraphQL is cool sometimes. I just like solving problems.
