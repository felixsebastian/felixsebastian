# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Felix Sebastian**, full stack dev, builder, vibe coder, creator of [LexiQuest](https://lexiquest.app) and [zapper](https://zapper.felixsebastian.dev).

I build web apps with a love for clean code and human centred design.

## Favourite tech

I'm big on TypeScript and Python; event driven tools like Kafka and Flink; cool databases like Cassandra, Neo4j. I just like solving problems.
